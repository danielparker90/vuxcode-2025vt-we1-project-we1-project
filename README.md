The aim of the project is to show how you have developed your website, the steps you have taken and the problems you have solved!

REMEMBER TO "COMMIT" YOUR CHANGES REGULARLY TO SHOW HOW YOU HAVE BUILT THIS PROJECT!

# Project Notes

I browsed through several travel sites as inspiration for my project to fit the clients needs. I grew up in London so I wanted to show what you should do in London when you visit and how you need to plan your trip. I created a contact page that works well to fulfil any clients needs.  

# Project Summary

My project was a multi page travel guide about London. As i said in the notes above I am from there and i wanted to show the client/clients what is the best things to do.
My project includes a Index page with the purpose of exploring and planning a trip to London. 

About London I providing a small background on the city
Plan your trip I gave advice on best times to visit and transport tips.
Top attractions I highlighted the key tourist spots for anyone visiting for the first time.
Contact me included a validated contact form using "formspree" for the client if they had anymore further questions.
I had an enjoyable time working on this project as being from London living in Sweden I get many questions almost every other week about London
so I thought it was only right to use that inspiration for my project. 

I learned a lot last term but unfortunately I could not finish due to personal problems but now I am at a place where I am extremely proud of this project for the time spent on it. 
What I would change?
I wish i did more on my other pages as they were quite similar such as more images, different layouts etc but due to my personal life I am happy how it turned out.
In my project I made sure I noted down every bug/problem I came across this time around to show how each problem was fixed and I also gave an in depth time report on what I did over the course of this project.
